# BJJ Ireland


BJJ Ireland is a site for a martial arts acadamy that gives users some information about what Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is, how they can sign up and how they can contact the acadamy. BJJ Ireland will be useful for people in taking up a new martial art and how to get started.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are black and white for simplicity and clasic design.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The main fonts I used for this project were Montserrat and Oswald. Monterrat is considered an easy to read and streamlined font and Oswald is and impactful sans serif font and together they make a nice visual pairing.


### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - There is an indentical navigation bar on all three pages that includes links to the Logo, Home page, Contact page and Sign Up page to allow for easy navigation.
  - The purpose on the Navigation bar is to allow users to easily navigate to any of the pages using any device without having to press the back button to revert to previous pages. It also shows a bottom border on hover when selecting a new page as well as a black border to allow users to know which page they are currently on.

  - The home page is a welcome page that includes a a grid of 3 images with text to the right side of them. The purpose of this is to provide an overview of what the martial art is, what the aim of the club is, who the club is run by and when class times are.

### Features Left to Implement

- I think it would be benefical to also include a gallery and video page demonstrating martial arts techniques to entice the user futher to join the club.

- I would also like to add an interactive timetable using a table feature in HTML.


## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment



- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
