# BJJ Ireland


BJJ Ireland is a site for a martial arts acadamy that gives users some information about what Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is, how they can sign up and how they can contact the acadamy. BJJ Ireland will be useful for people in taking up a new martial art and how to get started.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are black and white for simplicity and clasic design.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The main fonts I used for this project were Montserrat and Oswald. Monterrat is considered an easy to read and streamlined font and Oswald is and impactful sans serif font and together they make a nice visual pairing.

         #### Imagery
        -   Imagery was important for this site for not only design reasons but also to explain what the martial art looks like as it is quite unlike other martial arts. The large, background image on the signup page is designed to be eye-catching and pique the users interest. The grid on the homepage uses imagrry to try to visually explain to people what the martial art entails.



### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - There is an indentical navigation bar on all three pages that includes links to the Logo, Home page, Contact page and Sign Up page to allow for easy navigation.
  - The purpose on the Navigation bar is to allow users to easily navigate to any of the pages using any device without having to press the back button to revert to previous pages. It also shows a bottom border on hover when selecting a new page as well as a black border to allow users to know which page they are currently on.

### Features Left to Implement

- I think it would be benefical to also include a gallery and video page demonstrating martial arts techniques to entice the user futher to join the club.

- I would also like to add an interactive timetable using a table feature in HTML.


## Testing 

- For testing, I always had the preview open and would save and test that every feature worked. 
- I tried the site in multiple browsers and devices to test for bugs and although it is not as responsive as I would have liked it is readable and worked on all browsers and devices.
- I also had friends and family try on their respecive devices and found no bugs.
- I used chrome and mozilla developer tools when making the site to test out different dimensions and units to use.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment



- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
